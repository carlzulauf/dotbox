# Dotbox

My attempt to rethink my dotfiles in a way that makes them more portable, shareable, and compatible with immutable host operating systems (ie: os-tree distros).

I will strive to take advantage of containers for most of my dev tooling, using tools like distrobox to ease integration with the host OS.

## TODOs

* distrobox
  * arch
    * asdf
    * fish shell
  * ubuntu
* host OS
  * fish shell as defualt
  * ruby bins working
* vs code
* atom?
* sublime?
* zoom (flatpak?)
