# Dotbox

My attempt to rethink my dotfiles in a way that makes them more portable, shareable, and compatible with immutable host operating systems (ie: os-tree distros).

I will strive to take advantage of containers for most of my dev tooling, using tools like distrobox to ease integration with the host OS.
